# cool-sequence-
some numerical pattern that also makes cool geometric shapes when analysed 

Basically a simulation of a fascinating number theory problem, with code that lets you discover and visualize a hidden pattern connecting it to the prime numbers.

If you're a student or anyone who likes exploring mathematical rabbit holes and seeing how simple rules can generate complex, beautiful patterns, this is good for that. Just copy the code and run it in your Jupyter Notebook

What is this Code Doing?
This project investigates the dynamics for integers. It defines a unique transformation with two simple rules:
If a number k is odd, the next number is (k + 1) / 2.

If a number k is even, the next number is (n + k) / 2, where n is a parameter you can change.

there are 2 codes, one which shows you that if you take a string of n even numbers , how many iteration will the number at each of its positions will take to come back 
sometimes all of them come backl after the same iteration the other times some come back first and hence the order of the gth position varys in the n positions 


the other code shows you for what n lengths do all the numbers come back to the initial state in the same number of iterations 

and during all of this some cool pattersn emerge , i am not a number theorist so i do not know why all of this happens ( i know some of it tho )
but the patters are still interesting and apparently all the numbers come back in the sname number of iterations if n is some prime +1 

you can run it in jupyter to see what happens
